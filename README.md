# combine-proc-macro

[![combine-proc-macro on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/combine-proc-macro/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/combine-proc-macro)

A library that allows [proc_macro] function-like macros to be parsed using
the [combine] parser combinator crate.

[proc_macro]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/proc_macro/index.html
[combine]: https://docs.rs/crate/combine

## Usage

Put this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
combine-proc-macro = "1.0.0"
```

And this in your crate root:

```rust
extern crate combine_proc_macro;
```

To learn how the library is used, see some examples:
  - The `hello_macro` in the [documentation](https://docs.rs/combine-proc-macro).
  - The [grammar definition](https://github.com/kestred/crabwise-antlr-parser/blob/master/src/grammar.rs) in `crabwise-antlr-parser`.
  - A `#[proc_macro]` [implemented](https://github.com/kestred/crabwise-antlr-parser/blob/master/examples/macro_example/src/lib.rs) using `crabwise-antlr-parser`.

## Motivation
When writing a `#[proc_macro_derive]` the input is Rust source code which is
well supported by the `syn` crate.  However, when writing a `#[proc_macro]`
macro, it is common to want to define a custom domain specific language.

This crate allows you to write a parser for your DSL using the `combine`
parser combinator library. It also preserves the source _span_ information
in the parsed result such that `rustc` can provide correct source locations
for identifiers and literals that are re-used in the output.
